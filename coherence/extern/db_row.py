# I created this class and related functions because I like accessing
# database results by field name rather than field number.  Accessing
# by field number has many problems: code is less readable, code gets
# broken when field positions change or fields are added or deleted from
# the query, etc.
#
# This class should have little overhead if you are already using fetchall().
# It wraps each result row in a ResultRow class which allows you to
# retrieve results via a dictionary interface (by column name).  The regular
# list interface (by column number) is also provided.
#
# I can't believe the DB-API 2.0 api didn't include dictionary-style results.
# I'd love to see the reasoning behind not requiring them of database connection
# classes.

# This module comes from:
# http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/163605
