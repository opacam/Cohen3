 
Setting Up the Code for Local Development
-----------------------------------------

Here's how to set up `Cohen3` for local development.

1. Fork the `Cohen3` repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally::

    $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/Cohen3.git

3. Install your local copy into a virtualenv. Assuming you have `pyenv
   <https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv>`_ installed, this is how you set up your
   fork for local development::

    $ CONFIGURE_OPTS=--enable-shared pyenv install 3.7-dev
    $ CONFIGURE_OPTS=--enable-shared pyenv virtualenv 3.7-dev cohen3
    $ cd Cohen3/
    $ pyenv activate cohen3
    $ pip install pipenv
    $ pipenv install
    $ pip install -e .[dev]

4. Create a branch for local development::

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

Now you can make your changes locally.

5. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass the tests::

    $ pycodestyle coherence --statistics --ignore=E402
    $ pylint -E coherence --rcfile=.pylintrc
    $ py.test -v --cov=coherence --cov-report=term-missing tests

6. Check that the test coverage hasn't dropped:

    The last command of the above point (py.test), will print a report at the
    end of the tests (or you can check the results via your web browser: check
    the created folder "cover" and visualize the index.htm file for a nice
    report). Check that coverage percent against the coverage before the
    changes you made.

    :Note: You also can check the coverage once you submitted the pull requests
           and github-actions unit tests are done (but this, probably, it will be
           slower than do it manually from your os, because you can skip some steps
           that github-actions cannot skip).

7. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub::

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

8. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.
