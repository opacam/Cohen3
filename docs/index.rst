Overview
--------
Cohen3 is a DLNA/UPnP Media Server written in Python 3, providing several
UPnP MediaServers and MediaRenderers to make simple publishing and streaming
different types of media content to your network.

If you need the python 2 version you should take a look into the original project:
`Cohen Framework <https://github.com/unintended/cohen>`_ project managed by
the github user `unintended <mailto:unintended.github@gmail.com>`_

Cohen/Cohen3 are actually a highly simplified and refreshed versions of
`Coherence Framework <https://github.com/coherence-project/Coherence>`_
project by `Frank Scholz <mailto:dev@coherence-project.org>`_ which looks like
no longer supported.

Quickstart
----------
To just export some files on your hard-disk fire up Cohen with
an UPnP MediaServer with a file-system backend enabled::

  $ cohen3 --plugin=backend:FSStore,content:/path/to/your/media/files

You can also configure cohen via a config file. Feel free to check our example ``misc/cohen.conf.example``.
The config file can be placed anywhere, cohen looks by default for
``$HOME/.cohen3``, but you can pass the path via the commandline option
'-c' to it too::

  $ cohen3 -c /path/to/config/file
